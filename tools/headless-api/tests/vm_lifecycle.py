"""
The full per-VM test sequence, parametrized by a create-spec. The master harness
(run_all.py) runs this CONCURRENTLY across several specs (Linux + Windows on a
Windows host; a macOS guest on a macOS host) -- so multi-VM concurrency is
inherent where the platform has multiple guest types, and every path is proven
on each OS. Each call creates its own VM, runs everything against it, and
deletes it. There is no separate multi-VM test. Feature differences are
capability-gated via version()["capabilities"] (snapshots/templates are
Windows-only; those routes assert 501 on macOS).

Lifecycle discipline (mirrors the GUI):
  * Every VM start boots all the way to ONLINE (agent connected) before the VM is
    used -- the ONLY exceptions are the delete/edit-during-build tests, which
    deliberately act before the guest finishes installing.
  * Every shutdown is the GRACEFUL, agent-mediated one (asb_vm_shutdown -> hcs_stop_vm
    -> the guest agent's InitiateSystemShutdownExW / `systemctl`), sent once the
    agent is online -- with no agent the core returns ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED and nothing
    shuts down.
  * Force-stop (POST .../stop) is exercised in exactly ONE dedicated test.

SSH key auto-deploy is folded in here (no separate VM): each VM is created with
sshEnabled + sshDeployKey, and once online we assert the agent deployed the
AppSandbox public key (sshState 4 / keyDeployed) and that a key-only login works.
